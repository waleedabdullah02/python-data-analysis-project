# **Transaction Data Analysis Project**  

📊 **Project Overview**  
This is a mini Python project focused on analyzing transactional data. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from transaction records and visualize key patterns using Python. Through this project, I’ve practiced essential data analysis skills such as data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.

## **Project Objectives**  
🔍 **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, correct data types, and format currency fields.  
📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify patterns in product sales, peak transaction times, and store performance.  
📊 **Data Visualization:** Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful charts and graphs.  
🌐 **Optional Integration:** Future versions may incorporate weather or holiday data using APIs for deeper insights.

## **Technologies & Libraries Used**  
- **Python:** Core programming language for analysis.  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for running and documenting the analysis.  
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **numpy:** For numerical operations.  
- **matplotlib:** For static visualizations.  
- **seaborn:** For advanced data visualization.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project contains thousands of transaction records, with columns such as:  
- **Transaction ID**  
- **Transaction Date & Time**  
- **Product Category & Type**  
- **Store Location**  
- **Revenue and Quantity Sold**
